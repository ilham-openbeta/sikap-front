/** 
 * Second attempt at inserting text at a bookmark defined within a Word 
 * document. Note that there is one SERIOUS limitations with the code as it 
 * stands; at least only one as far as I am aware: nested bookmarks. 
 * 
 * It is possible to create a document and to nest one bookmark within another. 
 * Typically, a bookmark is inserted into a piece of text, that is then selected 
 * and another bookmark is added to that selection. The XML markup might look 
 * something like this 
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <w:p w:rsidR="00945150" w:rsidRDefault="00945150">
 *   <w:r>
 *     <w:t xml:space="preserve">
 *     Imagine I want to insert one bookmark at the start of this 
 *     </w:t>
 *   </w:r>
 *     <w:bookmarkStart w:id="0" w:name="OUTER"/>
 *       <w:r>
 *         <w:t xml:space="preserve">piece of text and another just 
 *         </w:t>
 *     </w:r>
 *   <w:proofErr w:type="gramStart"/>
 *   <w:r>
 *     <w:t xml:space="preserve">here 
 *     </w:t>
 *   </w:r>
 *   <w:bookmarkStart w:id="1" w:name="INNER"/>
 *   <w:bookmarkEnd w:id="1"/>
 *     <w:r>
 *       <w:t>. 
 *       </w:t>
 *     </w:r>
 *   <w:bookmarkEnd w:id="0"/>
 *   <w:proofErr w:type="gramEnd"/>
 * </w:p>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Using Word macros to conduct tests, a number of things have become apparent. 
 * The first is that within the Word Object Model, a Bookmark is considered to 
 * be a Range object and this limits the operations that can be performed on it. 
 * It is quite possible to insert some text in front of the bookmarks start tag 
 * or behind the bookmarks end tag. The text is never inserted into the markup 
 * between the bookmarkStart and bookmarkEnd rags and, therefore, will not 
 * replace any text that does already appear between them. With regard to 
 * styling, it seems as though the following guidelines hold true; 
 * 
 * 1. If text is being inserted before the bookmark, then it will 'inherit' any 
 * style information from the character run that immediately precedes it, if 
 * any. 2. If the text is being inserted after the bookmarkEnd tag then it will 
 * inherit it's styling from the nearest run element that is contained between 
 * the bookmarkEnd tag and it's matching bookmarkStart tag, if any. 
 * 
 * Currently, I am unsure on a couple of points; 
 * 
 * 1. Whether it is possible for a document to contain two or more bookmarks 
 * with the same name. Initial testing suggested that this is not possible but 
 * the code has been written as if it is. That is to say that once a bookmark is 
 * found the search for a subsequent bookmark with the same name will continue. 
 * This behaviour is easy to amend however. 
 * 2. Should the code offer a third 
 * option, to replace the text, if any, contained between the bookmarkStart and 
 * bookmarkEnd tags? If so, what should happen to any bookmarks that are 
 * contained between the start and end tags? 
 * 
 * @author Mark Beardsley 
 * @version 1.00 16th June 2012 
 *          1.10 20th June 2012 - Added the ability to replace the text between the opening 
 *                                and closing brackets ([ and ]) that appear when the document 
 *                                is open in Word.

    /** 
     * Inserts some text into a Word document in a position that is immediately

     * 
     * Bookmarks can take two forms, they can either simply mark a location 
     * within a document or they can do this but contain some text. The 
     * difference is obvious from looking at some XML markup. The simple 
     * placeholder bookmark will look like this; 
     * 
     * <pre>
     * 
     * <w:bookmarkStart w:name="AllAlone" w:id="0"/><w:bookmarkEnd w:id="0"/>
     * 
     * </pre>
     * 
     * Simply a pair of tags where one tag has the name bookmarkStart, the other 
     * the name bookmarkEnd and both share matching id attributes. In this case, 
     * the text will simply be inserted into the document at a point immediately 
     * after the bookmarkEnd tag. No styling will be applied to the text, it 
     * will simply inherit the documents defaults. 
     * 
     * The more complex case looks like this; 
     * 
     * <pre>
     * 
     * <w:bookmarkStart w:name="InStyledText" w:id="3"/>
     *   <w:r w:rsidRPr="00DA438C">
     *     <w:rPr>
     *       <w:rFonts w:hAnsi="Engravers MT" w:ascii="Engravers MT" w:cs="Arimo"/>
     *       <w:color w:val="FF0000"/>
     *     </w:rPr>
     *     <w:t>text</w:t>
     *   </w:r>
     * <w:bookmarkEnd w:id="3"/>
     * 
     * </pre>
     * 
     * Here, the user has selected the word 'text' and chosen to insert a 
     * bookmark into the document at that point. So, the bookmark tags 'contain' 
     * a character run that is styled. Inserting any text after this bookmark, 
     * it is important to ensure that the styling is preserved and copied over 
     * to the newly inserted text. 
     * 
     * The approach taken to dealing with both cases is similar but slightly 
     * different. In both cases, the code simply steps along the document nodes 
     * until it finds the bookmarkEnd tag whose ID matches that of the 
     * bookmarkStart tag. Then, it will look to see if there is one further node 
     * following the bookmarkEnd tag. If there is, it will insert the text into 
     * the paragraph immediately in front of this node. If, on the other hand, 
     * there are no more nodes following the bookmarkEnd tag, then the new run 
     * will simply be positioned at the end of the paragraph. 
     * 
     * Styles are dealt with by 'looking' for a 'w:rPr' element whilst iterating 
     * through the nodes. If one is found, its details will be captured and 
     * applied to the run before the run is inserted into the paragraph. If 
     * there are multiple runs between the bookmarkStart and bookmarkEnd tags 
     * and these have different styles applied to them, then the style applied 
     * to the last run before the bookmarkEnd tag - if any - will be cloned and 
     * applied to the newly inserted text. 
     * 
     * @param bookmark An instance of the CTBookmark class that encapsulates 
     * information about the bookmark. 
     * @param run An instance of the XWPFRun class that encapsulates the text 
     * that is to be inserted into the document following the bookmark. 
     * @param para An instance of the XWPFParagraph class that encapsulates that
